behavior Level Verilog
Combinational Logic vs Sequential Logic ("State")

## Why SystemVerilog?

"SystemVerilog is an extension of Verilog with many such verification features that allow engineers to verify the design using complex testbench structures and random stimuli in simulation." (Chipverify Tutorial)

- More features in OOP that will support complicated testing procedures

## Definitions

- DUT: Design Under Test. Directed or Constrained Random
- DUV: Design Under Verification
- UVM: Universal Verification Methodology. A verification framework built in SystemVerilog that uses object-oriented programming principles to create reusable, scalable, and modular testbenches for digital hardware designs
- RTL: Register Transfer Level
- TLM: Transaction Level Modeling
- HVL: Hardware Verification Language
- SVA: SystemVerilog Assertions
- Testbench
- FPGA: Field-Programmable Gate Array
- ASIC: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit

### Keys to Learn

- Real time systems running on distributed hardware
- Embedded Linux operating systems, device trees and interfacing FPGA logic to core software executables
- Serial protocols such as SPI. I2C, UART
- ASIC/FPGA verification environment utilizing UVM & System Verilog.

#### Introduction to Verification and SystemVerilog for Beginners

Speficication -> RTL -> Gates -> Silicon

Testbench can be written in the same HDL or a HVL

Structured Testbench. Testbench made of different components that each have specialist jobs to do.
ex: driver, monitor, checker, etc.
